Types Of Constructors:

There are five types of constructors available in C#, they are as follows

    Default or Parameter Less - System-Defined Implicit Constructor 
    Parameterized Constructor
    Copy Constructor
    Static Constructor
    Private Constructor

    1. Default or Prameter Less Constructor:
        1. System-Defined Default Constructor
           the Implicit Constructor which is always public and parameterless initialize the variables with default values and these default values you are seeing in the output. As this Implicit Constructor initializes the variables with default values, we also called this a System Defined Default Constructor
        2. User-Defined Default Constructor
        3. Copy Constructor
        4. Static Constructor
        5. Private Constructor

        In C#, within a class, we can define any number of constructors. But the most important point that you need to remember is that
        
        a. each and every constructor must have a different signature.
        b. A different signature means the number, type, and parameter order should be different.
        
        So, in a class, we can define one no-argument constructor plus ‘n’ number of parameterized constructors in C#
